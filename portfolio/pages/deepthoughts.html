            Overall, ever since I was young, I have loved learning about different STEM fields. After having taken APCS, I decided that I would try ACS, and so far I love it. I have learned so much already about HTML and CSS, which makes me excited to continue exploring. So far, I have enjoyed learning HTML and CSS because it allows me to show my creativity. Last year, in APCS, we worked on a holiday card project in which I also was able to display my crveativity and I built a nice house that I was very proud of. The main thing about HTML and CSS that I like better is that it is not as picky as Java was and there are multiple formats for completing the same action, which also gives me more freedom. I also feel that the formatting is a lot easier to do than Java's was and it is a lot easier to keep everything organized.</div>
