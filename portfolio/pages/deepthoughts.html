            Overall, ever since I was young, I have loved learning about different STEM fields. After having taken APCS, I decided that I would try ACS, and so far I love it. I have learned so much already about HTML and CSS, which makes me excited to continue exploring. So far, I have enjoyed learning HTML and CSS because it allows me to show my creativity. Last year, in APCS, we worked on a holiday card project in which I also was able to display my crveativity and I built a nice house that I was very proud of. The main thing about HTML and CSS that I like better is that it is not as picky as Java was and there are multiple formats for completing the same action, which also gives me more freedom. I also feel that the formatting is a lot easier to do than Java's was and it is a lot easier to keep everything organized.</div>

                While working on the lightning project, I was able to revisit a lot of things that I had learned last year in APCS on Processing. In fact, I was even able to implement the snow that I had used in my holiday card in this project as rain. The toughest part of this project was probably figuring out how to transform a Java version of my lightning project into a Javascript version.

                While working on the dice project, I found that it was quite easy to get one dice displayed on the screen, however the hardest part for me was figuring out how to get multiple dice on the screen and have all of the dots on the dice be positioned correctly. This project allowed some freedom in that I chose to do multiple different totals, along with an average. On top of that, I was able to implement a random die color generator that I had used on past projects.

                While working on the chemotaxis project, I ran into quite a bit of troubles, however none that really had to deal with my code. My main issue was that my pictures were not loading correctly so that took quite a while to figure out. However, much of the project was pretty easy to figure out besides also maybe determining how my bubbles were going to move so that they were not all just random.
